      THE PATH OF DUTY.

    <p>
      I am glad I said to you the other night at Doubleton, inquiring&mdash;too
      inquiring&mdash;compatriot, that I wouldn&rsquo;t undertake to tell you the
      story (about Ambrose Tester), but would write it out for you; inasmuch as,
      thinking it over since I came back to town, I see that it may really be
      made interesting. It <i>is</i> a story, with a regular development, and
      for telling it I have the advantage that I happened to know about it from
      the first, and was more or less in the confidence of every one concerned.
      Then it will amuse me to write it, and I shall do so as carefully and as
      cleverly as possible The first winter days in London are not madly gay, so
      that I have plenty of time; and if the fog is brown outside, the fire is
      red within. I like the quiet of this season; the glowing chimney-corner,
      in the midst of the December mirk, makes me think, as I sit by it, of all
      sorts of things. The idea that is almost always uppermost is the bigness
      and strangeness of this London world. Long as I have lived here,&mdash;the
      sixteenth anniversary of my marriage is only ten days off,&mdash;there is
      still a kind of novelty and excitement in it It is a great pull, as they
      say here, to have remained sensitive,&mdash;to have kept one&rsquo;s own point
      of view. I mean it&rsquo;s more entertaining,&mdash;it makes you see a thousand
      things (not that they are all very charming). But the pleasure of
      observation does not in the least depend on the beauty of what one
      observes. You see innumerable little dramas; in fact, almost everything
      has acts and scenes, like a comedy. Very often it is a comedy with tears.
      There have been a good many of them, I am afraid, in the case I am
      speaking of. It is because this history of Sir Ambrose Tester and Lady
      Vandeleur struck me, when you asked me about the relations of the parties,
      as having that kind of progression, that when I was on the point of
      responding, I checked myself, thinking it a pity to tell you a little when
      I might tell you all. I scarcely know what made you ask, inasmuch as I had
      said nothing to excite your curiosity. Whatever you suspected, you
      suspected on your own hook, as they say. You had simply noticed the pair
      together that evening at Doubleton. If you suspected anything in
      particular, it is a proof that you are rather sharp, because they are very
      careful about the way they behave in public. At least they think they are.
      The result, perhaps, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily follow. If I have been in their
      confidence you may say that I make a strange use of my privilege in
      serving them up to feed the prejudices of an opinionated American. You
      think English society very wicked, and my little story will probably not
      correct the impression. Though, after all, I don&rsquo;t see why it should
      minister to it; for what I said to you (it was all I did say) remains the
      truth. They are treading together the path of duty. You would be quite
      right about its being base in me to betray them. It is very true that they
      have ceased to confide in me; even Joscelind has said nothing to me for
      more than a year. That is doubtless a sign that the situation is more
      serious than before, all round,&mdash;too serious to be talked about. It
      is also true that you are remarkably discreet, and that even if you were
      not it would not make much difference, inasmuch as if you were to repeat
      my revelations in America, no one would know whom you were talking about.
      But all the same, I should be base; and, therefore, after I have written
      out my reminiscences for your delectation, I shall simply keep them for my
      own. You must content yourself with the explanation I have already given
      you of Sir Ambrose Tester and Lady Vandeleur: they are following&mdash;hand
      in hand, as it were&mdash;the path of duty. This will not prevent me from
      telling everything; on the contrary, don&rsquo;t you see?

    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      His brilliant prospects dated from the death of his brother, who had no
      children, had indeed steadily refused to marry. When I say brilliant
      prospects, I mean the vision of the baronetcy, one of the oldest in
      England, of a charming seventeenth-century house, with its park, in
      Dorsetshire, and a property worth some twenty thousand a year. Such a
      collection of items is still dazzling to me, even after what you would
      call, I suppose, a familiarity with British grandeur. My husband is n&rsquo;t a
      baronet (or we probably should n&rsquo;t be in London in December), and he is
      far, alas, from having twenty thousand a year. The full enjoyment of these
      luxuries, on Ambrose Tester&rsquo;s part, was dependent naturally, on the death
      of his father, who was still very much to the fore at the time I first
      knew the young man. The proof of it is the way he kept nagging at his
      sons, as the younger used to say, on the question of taking a wife. The
      nagging had been of no avail, as I have mentioned, with regard to Francis,
      the elder, whose affections were centred (his brother himself told me) on
      the winecup and the faro-table. He was not an exemplary or edifying
      character, and as the heir to an honorable name and a fine estate was very
      unsatisfactory indeed. It had been possible in those days to put him into
      the army, but it was not possible to keep him there; and he was still a
      very young man when it became plain that any parental dream of a &ldquo;career&rdquo;
       for Frank Tester was exceedingly vain. Old Sir Edmund had thought
      matrimony would perhaps correct him, but a sterner process than this was
      needed, and it came to him one day at Monaco&mdash;he was most of the time
      abroad&mdash;after an illness so short that none of the family arrived in
      time. He was reformed altogether, he was utterly abolished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second son, stepping into his shoes, was such an improvement that it
      was impossible there should be much simulation of mourning. You have seen
      him, you know what he is; there is very little mystery about him. As I am
      not going to show this composition to you, there is no harm in my writing
      here that he is&mdash;or at any rate he was&mdash;a remarkably attractive
      man. I don&rsquo;t say this because he made love to me, but precisely because he
      did n&rsquo;t. He was always in love with some one else,&mdash;generally with
      Lady Vandeleur. You may say that in England that usually does n&rsquo;t prevent;
      but Mr. Tester, though he had almost no intermissions, did n&rsquo;t, as a
      general thing, have duplicates. He was not provided with a second loved
      object, &ldquo;under-studying,&rdquo; as they say, the part. It was his practice to
      keep me accurately informed of the state of his affections,&mdash;a matter
      about which he was never in the least vague. When he was in love he knew
      it and rejoiced in it, and when by a miracle he was not he greatly
      regretted it. He expatiated to me on the charms of other persons, and this
      interested me much more than if he had attempted to direct the
      conversation to my own, as regards which I had no illusions. He has told
      me some singular things, and I think I may say that for a considerable
      period my most valued knowledge of English society was extracted from this
      genial youth. I suppose he usually found me a woman of good counsel, for
      certain it is that he has appealed to me for the light of wisdom in very
      extraordinary predicaments. In his earlier years he was perpetually in hot
      water; he tumbled into scrapes as children tumble into puddles. He invited
      them, he invented them; and when he came to tell you how his trouble had
      come about (and he always told the whole truth), it was difficult to
      believe that a man should have been so idiotic.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet he was not an idiot; he was supposed to be very clever, and
      certainly is very quick and amusing. He was only reckless, and
      extraordinarily natural, as natural as if he had been an Irishman. In
      fact, of all the Englishmen that I have known he is the most Irish in
      temperament (though he has got over it comparatively of late). I used to
      tell him that it was a great inconvenience that he didn&rsquo;t speak with a
      brogue, because then we should be forewarned, and know with whom we were
      dealing. He replied that, by analogy, if he were Irish enough to have a
      brogue he would probably be English, which seemed to me an answer
      wonderfully in character. Like most young Britons of his class he went to
      America, to see the great country, before he was twenty, and he took a
      letter to my father, who had occasion, <i>à propos</i> of some pickle of
      course, to render him a considerable service. This led to his coming to
      see me&mdash;I had already been living here three or four years&mdash;on
      his return; and that, in the course of time, led to our becoming fast
      friends, without, as I tell you, the smallest philandering on either side.
      But I must n&rsquo;t protest too much; I shall excite your suspicion. &ldquo;If he has
      made love to so many women, why should n&rsquo;t he have made love to you?&rdquo;&mdash;some
      inquiry of that sort you will be likely to make. I have answered it
      already, &ldquo;Simply on account of those very engagements.&rdquo; He could n&rsquo;t make
      love to every one, and with me it would n&rsquo;t have done him the least good.
      It was a more amiable weakness than his brother&rsquo;s, and he has always
      behaved very well. How well he behaved on a very important occasion is
      precisely the subject of my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was supposed to have embraced the diplomatic career; had been secretary
      of legation at some German capital; but after his brother&rsquo;s death he came
      home and looked out for a seat in Parliament. He found it with no great
      trouble and has kept it ever since. No one would have the heart to turn
      him out, he is so good-looking. It&rsquo;s a great thing to be represented by
      one of the handsomest men in England, it creates such a favorable
      association of ideas. Any one would be amazed to discover that the borough
      he sits for, and the name of which I am always forgetting, is not a very
      pretty place. I have never seen it, and have no idea that it is n&rsquo;t, and I
      am sure he will survive every revolution. The people must feel that if
      they should n&rsquo;t keep him some monster would be returned. You remember his
      appearance,&mdash;how tall, and fair, and strong he is, and always
      laughing, yet without looking silly. He is exactly the young man girls in
      America figure to themselves&mdash;in the place of the hero&mdash;when
      they read English novels, and wish to imagine something very aristocratic
      and Saxon. A &ldquo;bright Bostonian&rdquo; who met him once at my house, exclaimed as
      soon as he had gone out of the room, &ldquo;At last, at last, I behold it, the
      mustache of Roland Tremayne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Roland Tremayne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember in <i>A Lawless Love</i>, how often it&rsquo;s mentioned,
      and how glorious and golden it was? Well, I have never seen it till now,
      but now I <i>have</i> seen it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If you had n&rsquo;t seen Ambrose Tester, the best description I could give of
      him would be to say that he looked like Roland Tremayne. I don&rsquo;t know
      whether that hero was a &ldquo;strong Liberal,&rdquo; but this is what Sir Ambrose is
      supposed to be. (He succeeded his father two years ago, but I shall come
      to that.) He is not exactly what I should call thoughtful, but he is
      interested, or thinks he is, in a lot of things that I don&rsquo;t understand,
      and that one sees and skips in the newspapers,&mdash;volunteering, and
      redistribution, and sanitation, and the representation of minors&mdash;minorities&mdash;what
      is it? When I said just now that he is always laughing, I ought to have
      explained that I did n&rsquo;t mean when he is talking to Lady Vandeleur. She
      makes him serious, makes him almost solemn; by which I don&rsquo;t mean that she
      bores him. Far from it; but when he is in her company he is thoughtful; he
      pulls his golden mustache, and Roland Tremayne looks as if his vision were
      turned in, and he were meditating on her words. He does n&rsquo;t say much
      himself; it is she&mdash;she used to be so silent&mdash;who does the
      talking. She has plenty to say to him; she describes to him the charms
      that she discovers in the path of duty. He seldom speaks in the House, I
      believe, but when he does it&rsquo;s offhand, and amusing, and sensible, and
      every one likes it. He will never be a great statesman, but he will add to
      the softness of Dorsetshire, and remain, in short, a very gallant,
      pleasant, prosperous, typical English gentleman, with a name, a fortune, a
      perfect appearance, a devoted, bewildered little wife, a great many
      reminiscences, a great many friends (including Lady Vandeleur and myself),
      and, strange to say, with all these advantages, something that faintly
      resembles a conscience.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Five years ago he told me his father insisted on his marrying,&mdash;would
      not hear of his putting it off any longer. Sir Edmund had been harping on
      this string ever since he came back from Germany, had made it both a
      general and a particular request, not only urging him to matrimony in the
      abstract, but pushing him into the arms of every young woman in the
      country. Ambrose had promised, procrastinated, temporized; but at last he
      was at the end of his evasions, and his poor father had taken the tone of
      supplication. &ldquo;He thinks immensely of the name, of the place and all that,
      and he has got it into his head that if I don&rsquo;t marry before he dies, I
      won&rsquo;t marry after.&rdquo; So much I remember Ambrose Tester said to me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
      fixed idea; he has got it on the brain. He wants to see me married with
      his eyes, and he wants to take his grandson in his arms. Not without that
      will he be satisfied that the whole thing will go straight. He thinks he
      is nearing his end, but he isn&rsquo;t,&mdash;he will live to see a hundred,
      don&rsquo;t you think so?&mdash;and he has made me a solemn appeal to put an end
      to what he calls his suspense. He has an idea some one will get hold of me&mdash;some
      woman I can&rsquo;t marry. As if I were not old enough to take care of myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he is afraid of me,&rdquo; I suggested, facetiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is n&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; said my visitor, betraying by his tone that it was
      some one, though he didn&rsquo;t say whom. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all rot, of course; one
      marries sooner or later, and I shall do like every one else. If I marry
      before I die, it&rsquo;s as good as if I marry before he dies, is n&rsquo;t it? I
      should be delighted to have the governor at my wedding, but it is n&rsquo;t
      necessary for the legality, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked him what he wished me to do, and how I could help him. He knew
      already my peculiar views, that I was trying to get husbands for all the
      girls of my acquaintance and to prevent the men from taking wives. The
      sight of an ummarried woman afflicted me, and yet when my male friends
      changed their state I took it as a personal offence. He let me know that
      so far as he was concerned I must prepare myself for this injury, for he
      had given his father his word that another twelvemonth should not see him
      a bachelor. The old man had given him <i>carte blanche</i>; he made no
      condition beyond exacting that the lady should have youth and health.
      Ambrose Tester, at any rate, had taken a vow and now he was going
      seriously to look about him. I said to him that what must be must be, and
      that there were plenty of charming girls about the land, among whom he
      could suit himself easily enough. There was no better match in England, I
      said, and he would only have to make his choice. That however is not what
      I thought, for my real reflections were summed up in the silent
      exclamation, &ldquo;What a pity Lady Vandeleur isn&rsquo;t a widow!&rdquo; I hadn&rsquo;t the
      smallest doubt that if she were he would marry her on the spot; and after
      he had gone I wondered considerably what <i>she</i> thought of this turn
      in his affairs. If it was disappointing to me, how little it must be to <i>her</i>
      taste! Sir Edmund had not been so much out of the way in fearing there
      might be obstacles to his son&rsquo;s taking the step he desired. Margaret
      Vandeleur was an obstacle. I knew it as well as if Mr. Tester had told me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t mean there was anything in their relation he might not freely have
      alluded to, for Lady Vandeleur, in spite of her beauty and her tiresome
      husband, was not a woman who could be accused of an indiscretion. Her
      husband was a pedant about trifles,&mdash;the shape of his hatbrim, the <i>pose</i>
      of his coachman, and cared for nothing else; but she was as nearly a saint
      as one may be when one has rubbed shoulders for ten years with the best
      society in Europe. It is a characteristic of that society that even its
      saints are suspected, and I go too far in saying that little pinpricks
      were not administered, in considerable numbers to her reputation. But she
      did n&rsquo;t feel them, for still more than Ambrose Tester she was a person to
      whose happiness a good conscience was necessary. I should almost say that
      for her happiness it was sufficient, and, at any rate, it was only those
      who didn&rsquo;t know her that pretended to speak of her lightly. If one had the
      honor of her acquaintance one might have thought her rather shut up to her
      beauty and her grandeur, but one could n&rsquo;t but feel there was something in
      her composition that would keep her from vulgar aberrations. Her husband
      was such a feeble type that she must have felt doubly she had been put
      upon her honor. To deceive such a man as that was to make him more
      ridiculous than he was already, and from such a result a woman bearing his
      name may very well have shrunk. Perhaps it would have been worse for Lord
      Vandeleur, who had every pretension of his order and none of its
      amiability, if he had been a better, or at least, a cleverer man. When a
      woman behaves so well she is not obliged to be careful, and there is no
      need of consulting appearances when one is one&rsquo;s self an appearance. Lady
      Vandeleur accepted Ambrose Tester&rsquo;s attentions, and Heaven knows they were
      frequent; but she had such an air of perfect equilibrium that one could
      n&rsquo;t see her, in imagination, bend responsive. Incense was incense, but one
      saw her sitting quite serene among the fumes. That honor of her
      acquaintance of which I just now spoke it had been given me to enjoy; that
      is to say, I met her a dozen times in the season in a hot crowd, and we
      smiled sweetly and murmured a vague question or two, without hearing, or
      even trying to hear, each other&rsquo;s answer. If I knew that Ambrose Tester
      was perpetually in and out of her house and always arranging with her that
      they should go to the same places, I doubt whether she, on her side, knew
      how often he came to see me. I don&rsquo;t think he would have let her know, and
      am conscious, in saying this, that it indicated an advanced state of
      intimacy (with her, I mean).
    </p>
    <p>
      I also doubt very much whether he asked her to look about, on his behalf,
      for a future Lady Tester. This request he was so good as to make of me;
      but I told him I would have nothing to do with the matter. If Joscelind is
      unhappy, I am thankful to say the responsibility is not mine. I have found
      English husbands for two or three American girls, but providing English
      wives is a different affair. I know the sort of men that will suit women,
      but one would have to be very clever to know the sort of women that will
      suit men. I told Ambrose Tester that he must look out for himself, but, in
      spite of his promise, I had very little belief that he would do anything
      of the sort. I thought it probable that the old baronet would pass away
      without seeing a new generation come in; though when I intimated as much
      to Mr. Tester, he made answer in substance (it was not quite so crudely
      said) that his father, old as he was, would hold on till his bidding was
      done, and if it should not be done, he would hold on out of spite. &ldquo;Oh, he
      will tire me out;&rdquo; that I remember Ambrose Tester did say. I had done him
      injustice, for six months later he told me he was engaged. It had all come
      about very suddenly. From one day to the other the right young woman had
      been found. I forget who had found her; some aunt or cousin, I think; it
      had not been the young man himself. But when she was found, he rose to the
      occasion; he took her up seriously, he approved of her thoroughly, and I
      am not sure that he didn&rsquo;t fall a little in love with her, ridiculous
      (excuse my London tone) as this accident may appear. He told me that his
      father was delighted, and I knew afterwards that he had good reason to be.
      It was not till some weeks later that I saw the girl; but meanwhile I had
      received the pleasantest impression of her, and this impression came&mdash;must
      have come&mdash;mainly from what her intended told me. That proves that he
      spoke with some positiveness, spoke as if he really believed he was doing
      a good thing. I had it on my tongue&rsquo;s end to ask him how Lady Vandeleur
      liked her, but I fortunately checked this vulgar inquiry. He liked her
      evidently, as I say; every one liked her, and when I knew her I liked her
      better even than the others. I like her to-day more than ever; it is fair
      you should know that, in reading this account of her situation. It
      doubtless colors my picture, gives a point to my sense of the strangeness
      of my little story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joscelind Bernardstone came of a military race, and had been brought up in
      camps,&mdash;by which I don&rsquo;t mean she was one of those objectionable
      young women who are known as garrison hacks. She was in the flower of her
      freshness, and had been kept in the tent, receiving, as an only daughter,
      the most &ldquo;particular&rdquo; education from the excellent Lady Emily (General
      Bernardstone married a daughter of Lord Clandufly), who looks like a
      pink-faced rabbit, and is (after Joscelind) one of the nicest women I
      know. When I met them in a country-house, a few weeks after the marriage
      was &ldquo;arranged,&rdquo; as they say here, Joscelind won my affections by saying to
      me, with her timid directness (the speech made me feel sixty years old),
      that she must thank me for having been so kind to Mr. Tester. You saw her
      at Doubleton, and you will remember that though she has no regular beauty,
      many a prettier woman would be very glad to look like her. She is as fresh
      as a new-laid egg, as light as a feather, as strong as a mail-phaeton. She
      is perfectly mild, yet she is clever enough to be sharp if she would. I
      don&rsquo;t know that clever women are necessarily thought ill-natured, but it
      is usually taken for granted that amiable women are very limited. Lady
      Tester is a refutation of the theory, which must have been invented by a
      vixenish woman who was <i>not</i> clever. She has an adoration for her
      husband, which absorbs her without in the least making her silly, unless
      indeed it is silly to be modest, as in this brutal world I sometimes
      believe. Her modesty is so great that being unhappy has hitherto presented
      itself to her as a form of egotism,&mdash;that egotism which she has too
      much delicacy to cultivate. She is by no means sure that if being married
      to her beautiful baronet is not the ideal state she dreamed it, the weak
      point of the affair is not simply in her own presumption. It does n&rsquo;t
      express her condition, at present, to say that she is unhappy or
      disappointed, or that she has a sense of injury. All this is latent;
      meanwhile, what is obvious, is that she is bewildered,&mdash;she simply
      does n&rsquo;t understand; and her perplexity, to me, is unspeakably touching.
      She looks about her for some explanation, some light. She fixes her eyes
      on mine sometimes, and on those of other people, with a kind of searching
      dumbness, as if there were some chance that I&mdash;that they&mdash;may
      explain, may tell her what it is that has happened to her. I can explain
      very well, but not to her,&mdash;only to you!

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a brilliant match for Miss Bernardstone, who had no fortune at all,
      and all her friends were of the opinion that she had done very well After
      Easter she was in London with her people, and I saw a good deal of them,
      in fact, I rather cultivated them. They might perhaps even have thought me
      a little patronizing, if they had been given to thinking that sort of
      thing. But they were not; that is not in their line. English people are
      very apt to attribute motives,&mdash;some of them attribute much worse
      ones than we poor simpletons in America recognize, than we have even heard
      of! But that is only some of them; others don&rsquo;t, but take everything
      literally and genially. That was the case with the Bernardstones; you
      could be sure that on their way home, after dining with you, they would
      n&rsquo;t ask each other how in the world any one could call you pretty, or say
      that many people <i>did</i> believe, all the same, that you had poisoned
      your grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Emily was exceedingly gratified at her daughter&rsquo;s engagement; of
      course she was very quiet about it, she did n&rsquo;t clap her hands or drag in
      Mr. Tester&rsquo;s name; but it was easy to see that she felt a kind of maternal
      peace, an abiding satisfaction. The young man behaved as well as possible,
      was constantly seen with Joscelind, and smiled down at her in the kindest,
      most protecting way. They looked beautiful together; you would have said
      it was a duty for people whose color matched so well to marry. Of course
      he was immensely taken up, and did n&rsquo;t come very often to see me; but he
      came sometimes, and when he sat there he had a look which I did n&rsquo;t
      understand at first. Presently I saw what it expressed; in my drawing-room
      he was off duty, he had no longer to sit up and play a part; he would lean
      back and rest and draw a long breath, and forget that the day of his
      execution was fixed. There was to be no indecent haste about the marriage;
      it was not to take place till after the session, at the end of August It
      puzzled me and rather distressed me. that his heart should n&rsquo;t be a little
      more in the matter; it seemed strange to be engaged to so charming a girl
      and yet go through with it as if it were simply a social duty. If one had
      n&rsquo;t been in love with her at first, one ought to have been at the end of a
      week or two. If Ambrose Tester was not (and to me he did n&rsquo;t pretend to
      be), he carried it off, as I have said, better than I should have
      expected. He was a gentleman, and he behaved like a gentleman, with the
      added punctilio, I think, of being sorry for his betrothed. But it was
      difficult to see what, in the long run, he could expect to make of such a
      position. If a man marries an ugly, unattractive woman for reasons of
      state, the thing is comparatively simple; it is understood between them,
      and he need have no remorse at not offering her a sentiment of which there
      has been no question. But when he picks out a charming creature to gratify
      his father and <i>les convenances</i>, it is not so easy to be happy in
      not being able to care for her. It seemed to me that it would have been
      much better for Ambrose Tester to bestow himself upon a girl who might
      have given him an excuse for tepidity. His wife should have been healthy
      but stupid, prolific but morose. Did he expect to continue not to be in
      love with Joscelind, or to conceal from her the mechanical nature of his
      attentions? It was difficult to see how he could wish to do the one or
      succeed in doing the other. Did he expect such a girl as that would be
      happy if he did n&rsquo;t love her? and did he think himself capable of being
      happy if it should turn out that she was miserable? If she should n&rsquo;t be
      miserable,&mdash;that is, if she should be indifferent, and, as they say,
      console herself, would he like that any better?
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked myself all these questions and I should have liked to ask them of
      Mr. Tester; but I did n&rsquo;t, for after all he could n&rsquo;t have answered them.
      Poor young man! he did n&rsquo;t pry into things as I do; he was not analytic,
      like us Americans, as they say in reviews. He thought he was behaving
      remarkably well, and so he was&mdash;for a man; that was the strange part
      of it. It had been proper that in spite of his reluctance he should take a
      wife, and he had dutifully set about it. As a good thing is better for
      being well done, he had taken the best one he could possibly find. He was
      enchanted with&mdash;with his young lady, you might ask? Not in the least;
      with himself; that is the sort of person a man is! Their virtues are more
      dangerous than their vices, and Heaven preserve you when they want to keep
      a promise! It is never a promise to <i>you</i>, you will notice. A man
      will sacrifice a woman to live as a gentleman should, and then ask for
      your sympathy&mdash;for <i>him</i>! And I don&rsquo;t speak of the bad ones, but
      of the good. They, after all, are the worst Ambrose Tester, as I say, did
      n&rsquo;t go into these details, but synthetic as he might be, was conscious
      that his position was false. He felt that sooner or later, and rather
      sooner than later, he would have to make it true,&mdash;a process that
      could n&rsquo;t possibly be agreeable. He would really have to make up his mind
      to care for his wife or not to care for her. What would Lady Vandeleur say
      to one alternative, and what would little Joscelind say to the other? That
      is what it was to have a pertinacious father and to be an accommodating
      son. With me, it was easy for Ambrose Tester to be superficial, for, as I
      tell you, if I did n&rsquo;t wish to engage him, I did n&rsquo;t wish to disengage
      him, and I did n&rsquo;t insist Lady Vandeleur insisted, I was afraid; to be
      with her was of course very complicated; even more than Miss Bernardstone
      she must have made him feel that his position was false. I must add that
      he once mentioned to me that she had told him he ought to marry. At any
      rate, it is an immense thing to be a pleasant fellow. Our young fellow was
      so universally pleasant that of course his <i>fiancée</i> came in for her
      share. So did Lady Emily, suffused with hope, which made her pinker than
      ever; she told me he sent flowers even to her. One day in the Park, I was
      riding early; the Row was almost empty. I came up behind a lady and
      gentleman who were walking their horses, close to each other, side by side
      In a moment I recognized her, but not before seeing that nothing could
      have been more benevolent than the way Ambrose Tester was bending over his
      future wife. If he struck me as a lover at that moment, of course he
      struck her so. But that is n&rsquo;t the way they ride to-day.

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One day, about the end of June, he came in to see me when I had two or
      three other visitors; you know that even at that season I am almost always
      at home from six to seven. He had not been three minutes in the room
      before I saw that he was different,&mdash;different from what he had been
      the last time, and I guessed that something had happened in relation to
      his marriage. My visitors did n&rsquo;t, unfortunately, and they stayed and
      stayed until I was afraid he would have to go away without telling me
      what, I was sure, he had come for. But he sat them out; I think that by
      exception they did n&rsquo;t find him pleasant. After we were alone he abused
      them a little, and then he said, &ldquo;Have you heard about Vandeleur? He &lsquo;s
      very ill. She&rsquo;s awfully anxious.&rdquo; I had n&rsquo;t heard, and I told him so,
      asking a question or two; then my inquiries ceased, my breath almost
      failed me, for I had become aware of something very strange. The way he
      looked at me when he told me his news was a full confession,&mdash;a
      confession so full that I had needed a moment to take it in. He was not
      too strong a man to be taken by surprise,&mdash;not so strong but that in
      the presence of an unexpected occasion his first movement was to look
      about for a little help. I venture to call it help, the sort of thing he
      came to me for on that summer afternoon. It is always help when a woman
      who is not an idiot lets an embarrassed man take up her time. If he too is
      not an idiot, that does n&rsquo;t diminish the service; on the contrary his
      superiority to the average helps him to profit. Ambrose Tester had said to
      me more than once, in the past, that he was capable of telling me things,
      because I was an American, that he would n&rsquo;t confide to his own people. He
      had proved it before this, as I have hinted, and I must say that being an
      American, with him, was sometimes a questionable honor. I don&rsquo;t know
      whether he thinks us more discreet and more sympathetic (if he keeps up
      the system: he has abandoned it with me), or only more insensible, more
      proof against shocks; but it is certain that, like some other Englishmen I
      have known, he has appeared, in delicate cases, to think I would take a
      comprehensive view. When I have inquired into the grounds of this
      discrimination in our favor, he has contented himself with saying, in the
      British-cursory manner, &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know; you are different!&rdquo; I remember
      he remarked once that our impressions were fresher. And I am sure that now
      it was because of my nationality, in addition to other merits, that he
      treated me to the confession I have just alluded to. At least I don&rsquo;t
      suppose he would have gone about saying to people in general, &ldquo;Her husband
      will probably die, you know; then why should n&rsquo;t I marry Lady Vandeleur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the question which his whole expression and manner asked of me,
      and of which, after a moment, I decided to take no notice. Why shouldn&rsquo;t
      he? There was an excellent reason why he should n&rsquo;t It would just kill
      Joscelind Bernardstone; that was why he should n&rsquo;t? The idea that he
      should be ready to do it frightened me, and independent as he might think
      my point of view, I had no desire to discuss such abominations. It struck
      me as an abomination at this very first moment, and I have never wavered
      in my judgment of it. I am always glad when I can take the measure of a
      thing as soon as I see it; it &lsquo;s a blessing to <i>feel</i> what we think,
      without balancing and comparing. It&rsquo;s a great rest, too, and a great
      luxury. That, as I say, was the case with the feeling excited in me by
      this happy idea of Ambrose Tester&rsquo;s. Cruel and wanton I thought it then,
      cruel and wanton I thought it later, when it was pressed upon me. I knew
      there were many other people that did n&rsquo;t agree with me, and I can only
      hope for them that their conviction was as quick and positive as mine; it
      all depends upon the way a thing strikes one. But I will add to this
      another remark. I thought I was right then, and I still think I was right;
      but it strikes me as a pity that I should have wished so much to be right
      Why could n&rsquo;t I be content to be wrong; to renounce my influence (since I
      appeared to possess the mystic article), and let my young friend do as he
      liked? As you observed the situation at Doubleton, should n&rsquo;t you say it
      was of a nature to make one wonder whether, after all, one did render a
      service to the younger lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, as I say, I gave no sign to Ambrose Tester that I
      understood him, that I guessed what he wished to come to. He got no
      satisfaction out of me that day; it is very true that he made up for it
      later. I expressed regret at Lord Vandeleur&rsquo;s illness, inquired into its
      nature and origin, hoped it would n&rsquo;t prove as grave as might be feared,
      said I would call at the house and ask about him, commiserated discreetly
      her ladyship, and in short gave my young man no chance whatever. He knew
      that I had guessed his <i>arrière-pensée</i>, but he let me off for the
      moment, for which I was thankful; either because he was still ashamed of
      it, or because he supposed I was reserving myself for the catastrophe,&mdash;should
      it occur. Well, my dear, it did occur, at the end of ten days. Mr. Tester
      came to see me twice in that interval, each time to tell me that poor
      Vandeleur was worse; he had some internal inflammation which, in nine
      cases out of ten, is fatal. His wife was all devotion; she was with him
      night and day. I had the news from other sources as well; I leave you to
      imagine whether in London, at the height of the season, such a situation
      could fail to be considerably discussed. To the discussion as yet,
      however, I contributed little, and with Ambrose Tester nothing at all. I
      was still on my guard. I never admitted for a moment that it was possible
      there should be any change in his plans. By this time, I think, he had
      quite ceased to be ashamed of his idea, he was in a state almost of
      exaltation about it; but he was very angry with me for not giving him an
      opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I look back upon the matter now, there is something almost amusing in
      the way we watched each other,&mdash;he thinking that I evaded his
      question only to torment him (he believed me, or pretended to believe me,
      capable of this sort of perversity), and I determined not to lose ground
      by betraying an insight into his state of mind which he might twist into
      an expression of sympathy. I wished to leave my sympathy where I had
      placed it, with Lady Emily and her daughter, of whom I continued, bumping
      against them at parties, to have some observation. They gave no signal of
      alarm; of course it would have been premature. The girl, I am sure, had no
      idea of the existence of a rival. How they had kept her in the dark I
      don&rsquo;t know; but it was easy to see she was too much in love to suspect or
      to criticise. With Lady Emily it was different; she was a woman of
      charity, but she touched the world at too many points not to feel its
      vibrations. However, the dear little woman planted herself firmly; to the
      eye she was still enough. It was not from Ambrose Tester that I first
      heard of Lord Vandeleur&rsquo;s death; it was announced, with a quarter of a
      column of &ldquo;padding,&rdquo; in the <i>Times</i>. I have always known the <i>Times</i>
      was a wonderful journal, but this never came home to me so much as when it
      produced a quarter of a column about Lord Vandeleur. It was a triumph of
      word-spinning. If he had carried out his vocation, if he had been a tailor
      or a hatter (that&rsquo;s how I see him), there might have been something to say
      about him. But he missed his vocation, he missed everything but posthumous
      honors. I was so sure Ambrose Tester would come in that afternoon, and so
      sure he knew I should expect him, that I threw over an engagement on
      purpose. But he didn&rsquo;t come in, nor the next day, nor the next. There were
      two possible explanations of his absence. One was that he was giving all
      his time to consoling Lady Vandeleur; the other was that he was giving it
      all, as a blind, to Joscelind Bernardstone. Both proved incorrect, for
      when he at last turned up he told me he had been for a week in the
      country, at his father&rsquo;s. Sir Edmund also had been unwell; but he had
      pulled through better than poor Lord Vandeleur. I wondered at first
      whether his son had been talking over with him the question of a change of
      base; but guessed in a moment that he had not suffered this alarm. I don&rsquo;t
      think that Ambrose would have spared him if he had thought it necessary to
      give him warning; but he probably held that his father would have no
      ground for complaint so long as he should marry some one; would have no
      right to remonstrate if he simply transferred his contract. Lady Vandeleur
      had had two children (whom she had lost), and might, therefore, have
      others whom she should n&rsquo;t lose; that would have been a reply to nice
      discriminations on Sir Edmund&rsquo;s part.

    <p>
      In reality, what the young man had been doing was thinking it over beneath
      his ancestral oaks and beeches. His countenance showed this,&mdash;showed
      it more than Miss Bernardstone could have liked. He looked like a man who
      was crossed, not like a man who was happy, in love. I was no more disposed
      than before to help him out with his plot, but at the end of ten minutes
      we were articulately discussing it. When I say <i>we</i> were, I mean he
      was; for I sat before him quite mute, at first, and amazed at the
      clearness with which, before his conscience, he had argued his case. He
      had persuaded himself that it was quite a simple matter to throw over poor
      Joscelind and keep himself free for the expiration of Lady Vandeleur&rsquo;s
      term of mourning. The deliberations of an impulsive man sometimes land him
      in strange countries. Ambrose Tester confided his plan to me as a
      tremendous secret. He professed to wish immensely to know how it appeared
      to me, and whether my woman&rsquo;s wit could n&rsquo;t discover for him some loophole
      big enough round, some honorable way of not keeping faith. Yet at the same
      time he seemed not to foresee that I should, of necessity, be simply
      horrified. Disconcerted and perplexed (a little), that he was prepared to
      find me; but if I had refused, as yet, to come to his assistance, he
      appeared to suppose it was only because of the real difficulty of
      suggesting to him that perfect pretext of which he was in want. He
      evidently counted upon me, however, for some illuminating proposal, and I
      think he would have liked to say to me, &ldquo;You have always pretended to be a
      great friend of mine,&rdquo;&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t; the pretension was all on his side,&mdash;&ldquo;and
      now is your chance to show it. Go to Joscelind and make her feel (women
      have a hundred ways of doing that sort of thing), that through Vandeleur&rsquo;s
      death the change in my situation is complete. If she is the girl I take
      her for, she will know what to do in the premises.&rdquo;

      I was not prepared to oblige him to this degree, and I lost no time in
      telling him so, after my first surprise at seeing how definite his purpose
      had become. His contention, after all, was very simple. He had been in
      love with Lady Vandeleur for years, and was now more in love with her than
      ever. There had been no appearance of her being, within a calculable
      period, liberated by the death of her husband. This nobleman was&mdash;he
      didn&rsquo;t say what just then (it was too soon)&mdash;but he was only forty
      years old, and in such health and preservation as to make such a
      contingency infinitely remote. Under these circumstances, Ambrose had been
      driven, for the most worldly reasons&mdash;he was ashamed of them, pah!&mdash;into
      an engagement with a girl he did n&rsquo;t love, and did n&rsquo;t pretend to love.
      Suddenly the unexpected occurred; the woman he did love had become
      accessible to him, and all the relations of things were altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should n&rsquo;t he alter, too? Why should n&rsquo;t Miss Bernardstone alter, Lady
      Emily alter, and every one alter? It would be <i>wrong</i> in him to marry
      Joscelind in so changed a world;&mdash;a moment&rsquo;s consideration would
      certainly assure me of that. He could no longer carry out his part of the
      bargain, and the transaction must stop before it went any further. If
      Joscelind knew, she would be the first to recognize this, and the thing
      for her now was to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and tell her, then, if you are so sure of it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I wonder you
      have put it off so many days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me with a melancholy eye. &ldquo;Of course I know it&rsquo;s beastly
      awkward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was beastly awkward certainly; there I could quite agree with him, and
      this was the only sympathy he extracted from me. It was impossible to be
      less helpful, less merciful, to an embarrassed young man than I was on
      that occasion. But other occasions followed very quickly, on which Mr.
      Tester renewed his appeal with greater eloquence. He assured me that it
      was torture to be with his intended, and every hour that he did n&rsquo;t break
      off committed him more deeply and more fatally. I repeated only once my
      previous question,&mdash;asked him only once why then he did n&rsquo;t tell her
      he had changed his mind. The inquiry was idle, was even unkind, for my
      young man was in a very tight place. He did n&rsquo;t tell her, simply because
      he could n&rsquo;t, in spite of the anguish of feeling that his chance to right
      himself was rapidly passing away. When I asked him if Joscelind appeared
      to have guessed nothing, he broke out, &ldquo;How in the world can she guess,
      when I am so kind to her? I am so sorry for her, poor little wretch, that
      I can&rsquo;t help being nice to her. And from the moment I am nice to her she
      thinks it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could see perfectly what he meant by that, and I liked him more for this
      little generosity than I disliked him for his nefarious scheme. In fact, I
      did n&rsquo;t dislike him at all when I saw what an influence my judgment would
      have on him. I very soon gave him the full benefit of it. I had thought
      over his case with all the advantages of his own presentation of it, and
      it was impossible for me to see how he could decently get rid of the girl.
      That, as I have said, had been my original opinion, and quickened
      reflection only confirmed it. As I have also said, I had n&rsquo;t in the least
      recommended him to become engaged; but once he had done so I recommended
      him to abide by it. It was all very well being in love with Lady
      Vandeleur; he might be in love with her, but he had n&rsquo;t promised to marry
      her. It was all very well not being in love with Miss Bernardstone; but,
      as it happened, he had promised to marry her, and in my country a
      gentleman was supposed to keep such promises. If it was a question of
      keeping them only so long as was convenient, where would any of us be? I
      assure you I became very eloquent and moral,&mdash;yes, moral, I maintain
      the word, in spite of your perhaps thinking (as you are very capable of
      doing) that I ought to have advised him in just the opposite sense. It was
      not a question of love, but of marriage, for he had never promised to love
      poor Joscelind. It was useless his saying it was dreadful to marry without
      love; he knew that he thought it, and the people he lived with thought it,
      nothing of the kind. Half his friends had married on those terms. &ldquo;Yes,
      and a pretty sight their private life presented!&rdquo; That might be, but it
      was the first time I had ever heard him say it. A fortnight before he had
      been quite ready to do like the others. I knew what I thought, and I
      suppose I expressed it with some clearness, for my arguments made him
      still more uncomfortable, unable as he was either to accept them or to act
      in contempt of them. Why he should have cared so much for my opinion is a
      mystery I can&rsquo;t elucidate; to understand my little story, you must simply
      swallow it. That he did care is proved by the exasperation with which he
      suddenly broke out, &ldquo;Well, then, as I understand you, what you recommend
      me is to marry Miss Bernardstone, and carry on an intrigue with Lady
      Vandeleur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew perfectly that I recommended nothing of the sort, and he must have
      been very angry to indulge in this <i>boutade</i>. He told me that other
      people did n&rsquo;t think as I did&mdash;that every one was of the opinion that
      between a woman he did n&rsquo;t love and a woman he had adored for years it was
      a plain moral duty not to hesitate. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hesitate then!&rdquo; I exclaimed;
      but I did n&rsquo;t get rid of him with this, for he returned to the charge more
      than once (he came to me so often that I thought he must neglect both his
      other alternatives), and let me know again that the voice of society was
      quite against my view. You will doubtless be surprised at such an
      intimation that he had taken &ldquo;society&rdquo; into his confidence, and wonder
      whether he went about asking people whether they thought he might back
      out. I can&rsquo;t tell you exactly, but I know that for some weeks his dilemma
      was a great deal talked about. His friends perceived he was at the parting
      of the roads, and many of them had no difficulty in saying which one <i>they</i>
      would take. Some observers thought he ought to do nothing, to leave things
      as they were. Others took very high ground and discoursed upon the
      sanctity of love and the wickedness of really deceiving the girl, as that
      would be what it would amount to (if he should lead her to the altar).
      Some held that it was too late to escape, others maintained that it is
      never too late. Some thought Miss Bernardstone very much to be pitied;
      some reserved their compassion for Ambrose Tester; others, still, lavished
      it upon Lady Vandeleur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prevailing opinion, I think, was that he ought to obey the promptings
      of his heart&mdash;London cares so much for the heart! Or is it that
      London is simply ferocious, and always prefers the spectacle that is more
      entertaining? As it would prolong the drama for the young man to throw
      over Miss Bernardstone, there was a considerable readiness to see the poor
      girl sacrificed. She was like a Christian maiden in the Roman arena. That
      is what Ambrose Tester meant by telling me that public opinion was on his
      side. I don&rsquo;t think he chattered about his quandary, but people, knowing
      his situation, guessed what was going on in his mind, and he on his side
      guessed what they said. London discussions might as well go on in the
      whispering-gallery of St. Paul&rsquo;s. I could of course do only one thing,&mdash;I
      could but reaffirm my conviction that the Roman attitude, as I may call
      it, was cruel, was falsely sentimental. This naturally did n&rsquo;t help him as
      he wished to be helped,&mdash;did n&rsquo;t remove the obstacle to his marrying
      in a year or two Lady Vandeleur. Yet he continued to look to me for
      inspiration,&mdash;I must say it at the cost of making him appear a very
      feeble-minded gentleman. There was a moment when I thought him capable of
      an oblique movement, of temporizing with a view to escape. If he succeeded
      in postponing his marriage long enough, the Bernardstones would throw <i>him</i>
      over, and I suspect that for a day he entertained the idea of fixing this
      responsibility on them. But he was too honest and too generous to do so
      for longer, and his destiny was staring him in the face when an accident
      gave him a momentary relief. General Bernardstone died, after an illness
      as sudden and short as that which had carried off Lord Vandeleur; his wife
      and daughter were plunged into mourning and immediately retired into the
      country. A week later we heard that the girl&rsquo;s marriage would be put off
      for several months,&mdash;partly on account of her mourning, and partly
      because her mother, whose only companion she had now become, could not
      bear to part with her at the time originally fixed and actually so near.
      People of course looked at each other,&mdash;said it was the beginning of
      the end, a &ldquo;dodge&rdquo; of Ambrose Tester&rsquo;s. I wonder they did n&rsquo;t accuse him
      of poisoning the poor old general. I know to a certainty that he had
      nothing to do with the delay, that the proposal came from Lady Emily, who,
      in her bereavement, wished, very naturally, to keep a few months longer
      the child she was going to lose forever. It must be said, in justice to
      her prospective son-in-law, that he was capable either of resigning
      himself or of frankly (with however many blushes) telling Joscelind he
      could n&rsquo;t keep his agreement, but was not capable of trying to wriggle out
      of his difficulty. The plan of simply telling Joscelind he couldn&rsquo;t,&mdash;this
      was the one he had fixed upon as the best, and this was the one of which I
      remarked to him that it had a defect which should be counted against its
      advantages. The defect was that it would kill Joscelind on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think he believed me, and his believing me made this unexpected respite
      very welcome to him. There was no knowing what might happen in the
      interval, and he passed a large part of it in looking for an issue. And
      yet, at the same time, he kept up the usual forms with the girl whom in
      his heart he had renounced. I was told more than once (for I had lost
      sight of the pair during the summer and autumn) that these forms were at
      times very casual, that he neglected Miss Bernardstone most flagrantly,
      and had quite resumed his old intimacy with Lady Vandeleur. I don&rsquo;t
      exactly know what was meant by this, for she spent the first three months
      of her widowhood in complete seclusion, in her own old house in Norfolk,
      where he certainly was not staying with her. I believe he stayed some
      time, for the partridge shooting, at a place a few miles off. It came to
      my ears that if Miss Bernardstone did n&rsquo;t take the hint it was because she
      was determined to stick to him through thick and thin. She never offered
      to let him off, and I was sure she never would; but I was equally sure
      that, strange as it may appear, he had not ceased to be nice to her. I
      have never exactly understood why he didn&rsquo;t hate her, and I am convinced
      that he was not a comedian in his conduct to her,&mdash;he was only a good
      fellow. I have spoken of the satisfaction that Sir Edmund took in his
      daughter-in-law that was to be; he delighted in looking at her, longed for
      her when she was out of his sight, and had her, with her mother, staying
      with him in the country for weeks together. If Ambrose was not so
      constantly at her side as he might have been, this deficiency was covered
      by his father&rsquo;s devotion to her, by her appearance of being already one of
      the family. Mr. Tester was away as he might be away if they were already
      married.

    <h2>
      VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In October I met him at Doubleton; we spent three days there together. He
      was enjoying his respite, as he didn&rsquo;t scruple to tell me; and he talked
      to me a great deal&mdash;as usual&mdash;about Lady Vandeleur. He did n&rsquo;t
      mention Joscelind&rsquo;s name, except by implication in this assurance of how
      much he valued his weeks of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that, under the circumstances, Lady Vandeleur is
      willing to marry you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made this inquiry more expressively, doubtless, than before; for when we
      had talked of the matter then he had naturally spoken of her consent as a
      simple contingency. It was contingent upon the lapse of the first months
      of her bereavement; it was not a question he could begin to press a few
      days after her husband&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not immediately, of course; but if I wait, I think so.&rdquo; That, I remember,
      was his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wait till you get rid of that poor girl, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows nothing about that,&mdash;it&rsquo;s none of her business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say she does n&rsquo;t know you are engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should she know it, how should she believe it, when she sees how I
      love her?&rdquo; the young man exclaimed; but he admitted afterwards that he had
      not deceived her, and that she rendered full justice to the motives that
      had determined him. He thought he could answer for it that she would marry
      him some day or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she is a very cruel woman,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I should like, if you
      please, to hear no more about her.&rdquo; He protested against this, and, a
      month later, brought her up again, for a purpose. The purpose, you will
      see, was a very strange one indeed. I had then come back to town; it was
      the early part of December. I supposed he was hunting, with his own
      hounds; but he appeared one afternoon in my drawing-room and told me I
      should do him a great favor if I would go and see Lady Vandeleur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and see her? Where do you mean, in Norfolk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has come up to London&mdash;did n&rsquo;t you know it? She has a lot of
      business. She will be kept here till Christmas; I wish you would go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I go?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you be kept here till Christmas too,
      and is n&rsquo;t that company enough for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, you are cruel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a great shame of you,
      when a man is trying to do his duty and is behaving like a saint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that what you call saintly, spending all your time with Lady
      Vandeleur? I will tell you whom I think a saint, if you would like to
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need n&rsquo;t tell me; I know it better than you. I haven&rsquo;t a word to say
      against her; only she is stupid and hasn&rsquo;t any perceptions. If I am
      stopping a bit in London you don&rsquo;t understand why; it&rsquo;s as if you had n&rsquo;t
      any perceptions either! If I am here for a few days, I know what I am
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I understand?&rdquo; I asked,&mdash;not very candidly, because I
      should have been glad to. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your own affair; you know what you are
      about, as you say, and of course you have counted the cost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What cost do you mean? It&rsquo;s a pretty cost, I can tell you.&rdquo; And then he
      tried to explain&mdash;if I would only enter into it, and not be so
      suspicious. He was in London for the express purpose of breaking off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breaking off what,&mdash;your engagement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, damn my engagement,&mdash;the other thing. My acquaintance, my
      relations&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your intimacy with Lady Van&mdash;?&rdquo; It was not very gentle, but I
      believe I burst out laughing. &ldquo;If this is the way you break off, pray what
      would you do to keep up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flushed, and looked both foolish and angry, for of course it was not
      very difficult to see my point. But he was&mdash;in a very clumsy manner
      of his own&mdash;trying to cultivate a good conscience, and he was getting
      no credit for it. &ldquo;I suppose I may be allowed to look at her! It&rsquo;s a
      matter we have to talk over. One does n&rsquo;t drop such a friend in half an
      hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One does n&rsquo;t drop her at all, unless one has the strength to make a
      sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy for you to talk of sacrifice. You don&rsquo;t know what she is!&rdquo; my
      visitor cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know what she is not. She is not a friend, as you call her, if
      she encourages you in the wrong, if she does n&rsquo;t help you. No, I have no
      patience with her,&rdquo; I declared; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like her, and I won&rsquo;t go to see
      her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tester looked at me a moment, as if he were too vexed to trust himself
      to speak. He had to make an effort not to say something rude. That effort
      however, he was capable of making, and though he held his hat as if he
      were going to walk out of the house, he ended by staying, by putting it
      down again, by leaning his head, with his elbows on his knees, in his
      hands, and groaning out that he had never heard of anything so impossible,
      and that he was the most wretched man in England. I was very sorry for
      him, and of course I told him so; but privately I did n&rsquo;t think he stood
      up to his duty as he ought. I said to him, however, that if he would give
      me his word of honor that he would not abandon Miss Bernardstone, there
      was no trouble I would n&rsquo;t take to be of use to him. I did n&rsquo;t think Lady
      Vandeleur <i>was</i> behaving well. He must allow me to repeat that; but
      if going to see her would give him any pleasure (of course there was no
      question of pleasure for <i>her</i>) I would go fifty times. I could n&rsquo;t
      imagine how it would help him, but I would do it as I would do anything
      else he asked me. He did n&rsquo;t give me his word of honor, but he said
      quietly, &ldquo;<i>I</i> shall go straight; you need n&rsquo;t be afraid;&rdquo; and as he
      spoke there was honor enough in his face. This left an opening, of course,
      for another catastrophe. There might be further postponements, and poor
      Lady Emily, indignant for the first time in her life, might declare that
      her daughter&rsquo;s situation had become intolerable and that they withdrew
      from the engagement. But this was too odious a chance, and I accepted Mr.
      Tester&rsquo;s assurance. He told me that the good I could do by going to see
      Lady Vandeleur was that it would cheer her up, in that dreary, big house
      in Upper Brook Street, where she was absolutely alone, with horrible
      overalls on the furniture, and newspapers&mdash;actually newspapers&mdash;on
      the mirrors. She was seeing no one, there was no one to see; but he knew
      she would see me. I asked him if she knew, then, he was to speak to me of
      coming, and whether I might allude to him, whether it was not too
      delicate. I shall never forget his answer to this, nor the tone in which
      he made it, blushing a little, and looking away. &ldquo;Allude to me? Rather!&rdquo;
       It was not the most fatuous speech I had ever heard; it had the effect of
      being the most modest; and it gave me an odd idea, and especially a new
      one, of the condition in which, at any time, one might be destined to find
      Lady Vandeleur. If she, too, were engaged in a struggle with her
      conscience (in this light they were an edifying pair!) it had perhaps
      changed her considerably, made her more approachable; and I reflected,
      ingeniously, that it probably had a humanizing effect upon her. Ambrose
      Tester did n&rsquo;t go away after I had told him that I would comply with his
      request. He lingered, fidgeting with his stick and gloves, and I perceived
      that he had more to tell me, and that the real reason why he wished me to
      go and see Lady Vandeleur was not that she had newspapers on her mirrors.
      He came out with it at last, for that &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; of his (with the way I
      took it) had broken the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you don&rsquo;t think she behaved well&rdquo; (he naturally wished to defend
      her). &ldquo;But I dare say you don&rsquo;t understand her position. Perhaps you would
      n&rsquo;t behave any better in her place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you to imagine me there!&rdquo; I remarked, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awkward for me to say. One doesn&rsquo;t want to dot one&rsquo;s i&rsquo;s to that
      extent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would be delighted to marry you. That&rsquo;s not such a mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she likes me awfully,&rdquo; Mr. Tester said, looking like a handsome
      child. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not all on one side; it&rsquo;s on both. That&rsquo;s the difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean she won&rsquo;t let you go?&mdash;she holds you fast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the poor fellow had, in delicacy, said enough, and at this he jumped
      up. He stood there a moment, smoothing his hat; then he broke out again:
      &ldquo;Please do this. Let her know&mdash;make her feel. You can bring it in,
      you know.&rdquo; And here he paused, embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I bring in, Mr. Tester? That&rsquo;s the difficulty, as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you told me the other day. You know. What you have told me before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have told you&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it would put an end to Joscelind! If you can&rsquo;t work round to it,
      what&rsquo;s the good of being&mdash;you?&rdquo; And with this tribute to my powers he
      took his departure.

    <h2>
      VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was all very well of him to be so flattering, but I really did n&rsquo;t see
      myself talking in that manner to Lady Vandeleur. I wondered why he didn&rsquo;t
      give her this information himself, and what particular value it could have
      as coming from me. Then I said to myself that of course he <i>had</i>
      mentioned to her the truth I had impressed upon him (and which by this
      time he had evidently taken home), but that to enable it to produce its
      full effect upon Lady Yandeleur the further testimony of a witness more
      independent was required. There was nothing for me but to go and see her,
      and I went the next day, fully conscious that to execute Mr. Tester&rsquo;s
      commission I should have either to find myself very brave or to find her
      strangely confidential; and fully prepared, also, not to be admitted. But
      she received me, and the house in Upper Brook Street was as dismal as
      Ambrose Tester had represented it. The December fog (the afternoon was
      very dusky) seemed to pervade the muffled rooms, and her ladyship&rsquo;s pink
      lamplight to waste itself in the brown atmosphere. He had mentioned to me
      that the heir to the title (a cousin of her husband), who had left her
      unmolested for several months, was now taking possession of everything, so
      that what kept her in town was the business of her &ldquo;turning out,&rdquo; and
      certain formalities connected with her dower. This was very ample, and the
      large provision made for her included the London house. She was very
      gracious on this occasion, but she certainly had remarkably little to say.
      Still, she was different, or at any rate (having taken that hint), I saw
      her differently. I saw, indeed, that I had never quite done her justice,
      that I had exaggerated her stiffness, attributed to her a kind of
      conscious grandeur which was in reality much more an accident of her
      appearance, of her figure, than a quality of her character. Her appearance
      is as grand as you know, and on the day I speak of, in her simplified
      mourning, under those vaguely gleaming <i>lambris</i>, she looked as
      beautiful as a great white lily. She is very simple and good-natured; she
      will never make an advance, but she will always respond to one, and I saw,
      that evening, that the way to get on with her was to treat her as if she
      were not too imposing. I saw also that, with her nun-like robes and
      languid eyes, she was a woman who might be immensely in love. All the
      same, we hadn&rsquo;t much to say to each other. She remarked that it was very
      kind of me to come, that she wondered how I could endure London at that
      season, that she had taken a drive and found the Park too dreadful, that
      she would ring for some more tea if I did n&rsquo;t like what she had given me.
      Our conversation wandered, stumbling a little, among these platitudes, but
      no allusion was made on either side to Ambrose Tester. Nevertheless, as I
      have said, she was different, though it was not till I got home that I
      phrased to myself what I had detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, recalling her white face, and the deeper, stranger expression of her
      beautiful eyes, I entertained myself with the idea that she was under the
      influence of &ldquo;suppressed exaltation.&rdquo; The more I thought of her the more
      she appeared to me not natural; wound up, as it were, to a calmness
      beneath which there was a deal of agitation. This would have been nonsense
      if I had not, two days afterwards, received a note from her which struck
      me as an absolutely &ldquo;exalted&rdquo; production. Not superficially, of course; to
      the casual eye it would have been perfectly commonplace. But this was
      precisely its peculiarity, that Lady Vandeleur should have written me a
      note which had no apparent point save that she should like to see me
      again, a desire for which she did succeed in assigning a reason. She
      reminded me that she was paying no calls, and she hoped I wouldn&rsquo;t stand
      on ceremony, but come in very soon again, she had enjoyed my visit so
      much. We had not been on note-writing terms, and there was nothing in that
      visit to alter our relations; moreover, six months before, she would not
      have dreamed of addressing me in that way. I was doubly convinced,
      therefore, that she was passing through a crisis, that she was not in her
      normal state of nerves. Mr. Tester had not reappeared since the occasion I
      have described at length, and I thought it possible he had been capable of
      the bravery of leaving town. I had, however, no fear of meeting him in
      Upper Brook Street; for, according to my theory of his relations with Lady
      Vaudeleur, he regularly spent his evenings with her, it being clear to me
      that they must dine together. I could answer her note only by going to see
      her the next day, when I found abundant confirmation of that idea about
      the crisis. I must confess to you in advance that I have never really
      understood her behavior,&mdash;never understood why she should have taken
      me so suddenly&mdash;with whatever reserves, and however much by
      implication merely&mdash;into her confidence. All I can say is that this
      is an accident to which one is exposed with English people, who, in my
      opinion, and contrary to common report, are the most demonstrative, the
      most expansive, the most gushing in the world. I think she felt rather
      isolated at this moment, and she had never had many intimates of her own
      sex. That sex, as a general thing, disapproved of her proceedings during
      the last few months, held that she was making Joscelind Bernardstone
      suffer too cruelly. She possibly felt the weight of this censure, and at
      all events was not above wishing some one to know that whatever injury had
      fallen upon the girl to whom Mr. Tester had so stupidly engaged himself,
      had not, so far as she was concerned, been wantonly inflicted. I was
      there, I was more or less aware of her situation, and I would do as well
      as any one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed really glad to see me, but she was very nervous. Nevertheless,
      nearly half an hour elapsed, and I was still wondering whether she had
      sent for me only to discuss the question of how a London house whose
      appointments had the stamp of a debased period (it had been thought very
      handsome in 1850) could be &ldquo;done up&rdquo; without being made æsthetic. I forget
      what satisfaction I gave her on this point; I was asking myself how I
      could work round in the manner prescribed by Joscelind&rsquo;s intended. At the
      last, however, to my extreme surprise, Lady Vandeleur herself relieved me
      of this effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you know Mr. Tester rather well,&rdquo; she remarked, abruptly,
      irrelevantly, and with a face&rsquo; more conscious of the bearings of things
      than any I had ever seen her wear. On my confessing to such an
      acquaintance, she mentioned that Mr. Tester (who had been in London a few
      days&mdash;perhaps I had seen him) had left town and would n&rsquo;t come back
      for several weeks. This, for the moment, seemed to be all she had to
      communicate; but she sat looking at me from the corner of her sofa as if
      she wished me to profit in some way by the opportunity she had given me.
      Did she want help from outside, this proud, inscrutable woman, and was she
      reduced to throwing out signals of distress? Did she wish to be protected
      against herself,&mdash;applauded for such efforts as she had already made?
      I didn&rsquo;t rush forward, I was not precipitate, for I felt that now, surely,
      I should be able at my convenience to execute my commission. What
      concerned me was not to prevent Lady Vandeleur&rsquo;s marrying Mr. Tester, but
      to prevent Mr. Tester&rsquo;s marrying her. In a few moments&mdash;with the same
      irrelevance&mdash;she announced to me that he wished to, and asked whether
      I didn&rsquo;t know it I saw that this was my chance, and instantly, with
      extreme energy, I exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t listen to him! It would kill Miss
      Bernardstone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of my voice made her color a little, and she repeated, &ldquo;Miss
      Bernardstone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl he is engaged to,&mdash;or has been,&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know?
      Excuse me, I thought every one knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know he is dreadfully entangled. He was fairly hunted down.&rdquo;
       Lady Vandeleur was silent a moment, and then she added, with a strange
      smile, &ldquo;Fancy, in such a situation, his wanting to marry me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy!&rdquo; I replied. I was so struck with the oddity of her telling me her
      secrets that for the moment my indignation did not come to a head,&mdash;my
      indignation, I mean, at her accusing poor Lady Emily (and even the girl
      herself) of having &ldquo;trapped&rdquo; our friend. Later I said to myself that I
      supposed she was within her literal right in abusing her rival, if she was
      trying sincerely to give him up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about his having
      been hunted down,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but this I do know, Lady Vandeleur, I assure
      you, that if he should throw Joscelind over she would simply go out like
      that!&rdquo; And I snapped my fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Vandeleur listened to this serenely enough; she tried at least to
      take the air of a woman who has no need of new arguments. &ldquo;Do you know her
      very well?&rdquo; she asked, as if she had been struck by my calling Miss
      Bernardstone by her Christian name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well enough to like her very much.&rdquo; I was going to say &ldquo;to pity her;&rdquo; but
      I thought better of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be a person of very little spirit. If a man were to jilt me, I
      don&rsquo;t think I should go out!&rdquo; cried her ladyship with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is more probable than that she has not your courage or your
      wisdom. She may be weak, but she is passionately in love with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked straight into Lady Vandeleur&rsquo;s eyes as I said this, and I was
      conscious that it was a tolerably good description of my hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think she would really die?&rdquo; she asked in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Die as if one should stab her with a knife. Some people don&rsquo;t believe in
      broken hearts,&rdquo; I continued. &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t till I knew Joscelind
      Bernardstone; then I felt that she had one that would n&rsquo;t be proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One ought to live,&mdash;one ought always to live,&rdquo; said Lady Yandeleur;
      &ldquo;and always to hold up one&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I suppose that one ought n&rsquo;t to feel at all, if one wishes to be a
      great success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you call a great success?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never having occasion to be pitied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being pitied? That must be odious!&rdquo; she said; and I saw that though she
      might wish for admiration, she would never wish for sympathy. Then, in a
      moment, she added that men, in her opinion, were very base,&mdash;a remark
      that was deep, but not, I think, very honest; that is, in so far as the
      purpose of it had been to give me the idea that Ambrose Tester had done
      nothing but press her, and she had done nothing but resist. They were very
      odd, the discrepancies in the statements of each of this pair; but it must
      be said for Lady Vandeleur that now that she had made up her mind (as I
      believed she had) to sacrifice herself, she really persuaded herself that
      she had not had a moment of weakness. She quite unbosomed herself, and I
      fairly assisted at her crisis. It appears that she had a conscience,&mdash;very
      much so, and even a high ideal of duty. She represented herself as moving
      heaven and earth to keep Ambrose Tester up to the mark, and you would
      never have guessed from what she told me that she had entertained ever so
      faintly the idea of marrying him. I am sure this was a dreadful
      perversion, but I forgave it on the score of that exaltation of which I
      have spoken. The things she said, and the way she said them, come back to
      me, and I thought that if she looked as handsome as that when she preached
      virtue to Mr. Tester, it was no wonder he liked the sermon to be going on
      perpetually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you know what old friends we are; but that does n&rsquo;t make any
      difference, does it? Nothing would induce me to marry him,&mdash;I have
      n&rsquo;t the smallest intention of marrying again. It is not a time for me to
      think of marrying, before his lordship has been dead six months. The girl
      is nothing to me; I know nothing about her, and I don&rsquo;t wish to know; but
      I should be very, very sorry if she were unhappy. He is the best friend I
      ever had, but I don&rsquo;t see that that&rsquo;s any reason I should marry him, do
      you?&rdquo; Lady Vaudeleur appealed to me, but without waiting for my answers,
      asking advice in spite of herself, and then remembering it was beneath her
      dignity to appear to be in need of it. &ldquo;I have told him that if he does
      n&rsquo;t act properly I shall never speak to him again. She&rsquo;s a charming girl,
      every one says, and I have no doubt she will make him perfectly happy. Men
      don&rsquo;t feel things like women, I think, and if they are coddled and
      flattered they forget the rest. I have no doubt she is very sufficient for
      all that. For me, at any rate, once I see a thing in a certain way, I must
      abide by that I think people are so dreadful,&mdash;they do such horrible
      things. They don&rsquo;t seem to think what one&rsquo;s duty may be. I don&rsquo;t know
      whether you think much about that, but really one must at times, don&rsquo;t you
      think so? Every one is so selfish, and then, when they have never made an
      effort or a sacrifice themselves, they come to you and talk such a lot of
      hypocrisy. I know so much better than any one else whether I should marry
      or not. But I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that I don&rsquo;t see why I should. I am
      not in such a bad position,&mdash;with my liberty and a decent
      maintenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this manner she rambled on, gravely and communicatively, contradicting
      herself at times; not talking fast (she never did), but dropping one
      simple sentence, with an interval, after the other, with a certain
      richness of voice which always was part of the charm of her presence. She
      wished to be convinced against herself, and it was a comfort to her to
      hear herself argue. I was quite willing to be part of the audience, though
      I had to confine myself to very superficial remarks; for when I had said
      the event I feared would kill Miss Bernardstone I had said everything that
      was open to me. I had nothing to do with Lady Vandeleur&rsquo;s marrying, apart
      from that I probably disappointed her. She had caught a glimpse of the
      moral beauty of self-sacrifice, of a certain ideal of conduct (I imagine
      it was rather new to her), and would have been glad to elicit from me, as
      a person of some experience of life, an assurance that such joys are not
      insubstantial. I had no wish to wind her up to a spiritual ecstasy from
      which she would inevitably descend again, and I let her deliver herself
      according to her humor, without attempting to answer for it that she would
      find renunciation the road to bliss. I believed that if she should give up
      Mr. Tester she would suffer accordingly; but I did n&rsquo;t think that a reason
      for not giving him up. Before I left her she said to me that nothing would
      induce her to do anything that she did n&rsquo;t think right. &ldquo;It would be no
      pleasure to me, don&rsquo;t you see? I should be always thinking that another
      way would have been better. Nothing would induce me,&mdash;nothing,
      nothing!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      She protested too much, perhaps, but the event seemed to show that she was
      in earnest. I have described these two first visits of mine in some
      detail, but they were not the only ones I paid her. I saw her several
      times again, before she left town, and we became intimate, as London
      intimacies are measured. She ceased to protest (to my relief, for it made
      me nervous), she was very gentle, and gracious, and reasonable, and there
      was something in the way she looked and spoke that told me that for the
      present she found renunciation its own reward. So far, my scepticism was
      put to shame; her spiritual ecstasy maintained itself. If I could have
      foreseen then that it would maintain itself till the present hour I should
      have felt that Lady Vandeleur&rsquo;s moral nature is finer indeed than mine. I
      heard from her that Mr. Tester remained at his father&rsquo;s, and that Lady
      Emily and her daughter were also there. The day for the wedding had been
      fixed, and the preparations were going rapidly forward. Meanwhile&mdash;she
      didn&rsquo;t tell me, but I gathered it from things she dropped&mdash;she was in
      almost daily correspondence with the young man. I thought this a strange
      concomitant of his bridal arrangements; but apparently, henceforth, they
      were bent on convincing each other that the torch of virtue lighted their
      steps, and they couldn&rsquo;t convince each other too much. She intimated to me
      that she had now effectually persuaded him (always by letter), that he
      would fail terribly if he should try to found his happiness on an injury
      done to another, and that of course she could never be happy (in a union
      with him), with the sight of his wretchedness before her. That a good deal
      of correspondence should be required to elucidate this is perhaps after
      all not remarkable. One day, when I was sitting with her (it was just
      before she left town), she suddenly burst into tears. Before we parted I
      said to her that there were several women in London I liked very much,&mdash;that
      was common enough,&mdash;but for her I had a positive respect, and that
      was rare. My respect continues still, and it sometimes makes me furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the middle of January Ambrose Tester reappeared in town. He told me
      he came to bid me good-by. He was going to be beheaded. It was no use
      saying that old relations would be the same after a man was married; they
      would be different, everything would be different. I had wanted him to
      marry, and now I should see how I liked it He did n&rsquo;t mention that I had
      also wanted him not to marry, and I was sure that if Lady Vandeleur had
      become his wife, she would have been a much greater impediment to our
      harmless friendship than Joscelind Bernardstone would ever be. It took me
      but a short time to observe that he was in very much the same condition as
      Lady Vandeleur. He was finding how sweet it is to renounce, hand in hand
      with one we love. Upon him, too, the peace of the Lord had descended. He
      spoke of his father&rsquo;s delight at the nuptials being so near at hand; at
      the festivities that would take place in Dorsetshire when he should bring
      home his bride. The only allusion he made to what we had talked of the
      last time we were together was to exclaim suddenly, &ldquo;How can I tell you
      how easy she has made it? She is so sweet, so noble. She really is a
      perfect creature!&rdquo; I took for granted that he was talking of his future
      wife, but in a moment, as we were at cross-purposes, perceived that he
      meant Lady Vandeleur. This seemed to me really ominous. It stuck in my
      mind after he had left me. I was half tempted to write him a note, to say,
      &ldquo;There is, after all, perhaps, something worse than your jilting Miss
      Bernardstone would be; and that is the danger that your rupture with Lady
      Vandeleur may become more of a bond than your marrying her would have been
      For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, let your sacrifice <i>be</i> a sacrifice; keep it in
      its proper place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course I did n&rsquo;t write; even the slight responsibility I had already
      incurred began to frighten me, and I never saw Mr. Tester again till he
      was the husband of Joscelind Bernardstone. They have now been married some
      four years; they have two children, the eldest of whom is, as he should
      be, a boy. Sir Edmund waited till his grandson had made good his place in
      the world, and then, feeling it was safe, he quietly, genially surrendered
      his trust. He died, holding the hand of his daughter-in-law, and giving it
      doubtless a pressure which was an injunction to be brave. I don&rsquo;t know
      what he thought of the success of his plan for his son; but perhaps, after
      all, he saw nothing amiss, for Joscelind is the last woman in the world to
      have troubled him with her sorrows. From him, no doubt, she successfully
      concealed that bewilderment on which I have touched. You see I speak of
      her sorrows as if they were a matter of common recognition; certain it is
      that any one who meets her must see that she does n&rsquo;t pass her life in
      joy. Lady Vandeleur, as you know, has never married again; she is still
      the most beautiful widow in England. She enjoys the esteem of every one,
      as well as the approbation of her conscience, for every one knows the
      sacrifice she made, knows that she was even more in love with Sir Ambrose
      than he was with her. She goes out again, of course, as of old, and she
      constantly meets the baronet and his wife. She is supposed to be even
      &ldquo;very nice&rdquo; to Lady Tester, and she certainly treats her with exceeding
      civility. But you know (or perhaps you don&rsquo;t know) all the deadly things
      that, in London, may lie beneath that method. I don&rsquo;t in the least mean
      that Lady Vandeleur has any deadly intentions; she is a very good woman,
      and I am sure that in her heart she thinks she lets poor Joscelind off
      very easily. But the result of the whole situation is that Joscelind is in
      dreadful fear of her, for how can she help seeing that she has a very
      peculiar power over her husband? There couldn&rsquo;t have been a better
      occasion for observing the three together (if together it may be called,
      when Lady Tester is so completely outside), than those two days of ours at
      Doubleton. That&rsquo;s a house where they have met more than once before; I
      think she and Sir Ambrose like it. By &ldquo;she&rdquo; I mean, as he used to mean,
      Lady Vandeleur. You saw how Lady Tester was absolutely white with
      uneasiness. What can she do when she meets everywhere the implication that
      if two people in our time have distinguished themselves for their virtue,
      it is her husband and Lady Vandeleur? It is my impression that this pair
      are exceedingly happy. His marriage <i>has</i> made a difference, and I
      see him much less frequently and less intimately. But when I meet him I
      notice in him a kind of emanation of quiet bliss. Yes, they are certainly
      in felicity, they have trod the clouds together, they have soared into the
      blue, and they wear in their faces the glory of those altitudes. They
      encourage, they cheer, inspire, sustain, each other, remind each other
      that they have chosen the better part Of course they have to meet for this
      purpose, and their interviews are filled, I am sure, with its sanctity. He
      holds up his head, as a man may who on a very critical occasion behaved
      like a perfect gentleman. It is only poor Joscelind that droops. Have n&rsquo;t
      I explained to you now why she does n&rsquo;t understand?
